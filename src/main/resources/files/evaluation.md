Here are some of the things we took into consideration whilst evaluating your submission:

    * is the code well-structured and readable?
    * do classes / methods do what their name is suggesting?
    * are classes / methods divided into logical segments?
    * are you making use of modern Java API’s (e.g. streaming API or diamond operator)?
    * did you pull in appropriate dependencies?
* Does your app do what it was supposed to do?
    * Can your app be invoked via ’java -jar YourApp.jar <start> <end>‘ and does it output the correct path between the given start flow node ID and end flow node ID?
* Did you handle edge-cases?
    * start flow node ID == end flow node ID
    * Non-existing flow node ID
    * Non-existing path between provided flow node IDs
    * Circular paths
    * Missing arguments
* Are you aware of any limitations of your app and did you mention those as answers to the additional questions we asked you?
